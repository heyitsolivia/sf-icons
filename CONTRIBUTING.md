## Icon Requests


####To put in a request for a new icon, open a new issue with the following:

1. Title your new issue as `Icon Request: Icon Name`

2. Describe the new icon and list a couple of use cases for the icon
   ```
   Icon: a pencil or a pencil on notepad
   Use: indicates editing, or updating action
   ```

3. Label the issue as `New Icon` if it doesn't exist yet. If it exists but you need a variation (i.e. there is a Left Arrow but you need a Right Arrow), label the issue as `Icon Variation` instead.

4. Add addition labels as necessary:

   `Brand` Used for brands like Facebook, Twitter
   
   `UX`  Used for directly actionable icons. Add, Close, Heart, Flag
   
   `Symbols` Used for less actionable icons to indicate meaning rather than action. User, Important, Settings
   
   `Industry` Used for more abstract concepts in the opengov space like Transparency, Influence, Lobbying


####To put in a request to update an icon, open a new issue with the following:

1. Title your new issue as `Icon Update Request: Icon Name` where Icon Name is the existing icon

2. Explain why the icon needs updating and describe the necessary changes
   ```
   Reason: Pencil on notepad is too complex
   Changes: Remove notepad, and leave just the pencil
   ```
3. Label the issue as `Icon Update`
